Problem Statement
-
Samantha, a budding programmer, is learning about iterative loops and their use in calculating mathematical functions. She wants to calculate the factorial of a number using an iterative approach while understanding how the result evolves step-by-step. 
Can you help her by writing a program that calculates the factorial iteratively and prints the intermediate results at each step?

**Input format :**
The input consists of an integer n, representing the number for which the factorial is to be calculated.

**Output format :**
The first line of output prints the intermediate steps for each iteration of the loop in the format: "Iteration i: factorial = previous_factorial * i = current_factorial", where i is the current iteration number.
After completing all iterations, print the final result as "Factorial of n is <result>".

```c
